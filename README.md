- Explore and examine the computer programming to effectively control Microcontroller systems
- Demonstrate an understanding of the Programming Design Cycle as it relates to Microcontroller Systems

# Our Project
For this assignment, I collaborated with two other classmates and recreated an alarm system that will be used in a prison to indicate when someone has either broken in or out to the prison or when the system has been hacked.
