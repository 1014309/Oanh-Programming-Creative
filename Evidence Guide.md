# Aim
The aim of our minor project was to create a creative response to Microcontroller systems. 

# Unit Goals
- Demonstrate an understanding of microcontrollers and interfacing electronic hardware as it relates to a Microcontroller system 
- Explore and examine the computer programming to effectively control Microcontroller systems
- Demonstrate an understanding of the Programming Design Cycle as it relates to Microcontroller Systems

# Our Project
For this assignment, I collaborated with two other classmates and recreated an alarm system that will be used in a prison to indicate when someone has either broken in or out to the prison or when the system has been hacked. To recreate this we had to identify the individual components of the alarm; (i) flashing red lights; (ii) sound of the alarm; (iii) opening and closing of doors. 

# Summary of LEDs and RGB pins
Each group member was assigned to research one of the following components. For the flashing lights, it was predetermined that an LED would be used. Whilst using a normal red LED would work for this project, it was also recommended that I looked into other alternatives such as RGB LEDS to recreate the flashing lights. 'RGB' is the acronym or abbreviated term for 'red, green, blue'. Like the name, RGB light emit red, green and blue lights but colours other than red, green or blue can be created by adjusting the intensity of the red, green and blue hues.
